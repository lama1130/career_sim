    <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fitness: I go to the gym 4-5 days a week and also enjoy running and mountain biking</li>
            <li>Writing: I have been writing in various formats since I was a kid. As a kid I wrote short stories, 
                as I got older I started writing for online gaming websites as a hobby, 
                and to this day I still write wherever I can in a multitide of formats such as songwriting and longform.</li>
            <li>Permanently Amateur Comedian: A few years ago I wanted to try something new and gave stand-up comedy a try. 
                My first comedy open mic was terrifying and thrilling and I got bit by the comedy bug hard.
                 I've been doing 2-3 open mics / local shows a week ever since.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Professional Proficiencies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Business Planning</li>
            <li>Data Analysis</li>
            <li>Web Development</li>
            <li>Public Speaking</li>
            

        </ul>
    <h2>Everything Else</h2>
        <p>I grew up and still live in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is increasingly unique 
            for the area as more people have relocated to the Bay for work. My family, as well as my wife's, 
            all live near each other in the South Bay so I'm fortunate to be surrounded by lots of family. As for my own family,
             I am married and have two young boys who, depending on the day, are either keeping me young or making me old. My free time
            is divided between spending time with family, getting dinner with friends, fitness, and various 
            "me time" activites like stand-up and video games. It's a full-cup lifecycle and it's perfect.</p>
