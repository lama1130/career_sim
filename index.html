    <div class="mission">
        <p>Every day, at some point, each and every one of us stops and thinks to ourselves, 
            'There has to be a better way to do this,' but only a few people act on it. I am here to act;
            to be a pioneer, to be an innovator, to be a builder. My mission is to answer the call
            and make the world better for each and every one of you.
